# WPSS Validation Tool version 4.0.1

The WPSS Validation Tool provides web developers and quality assurance testers the ability to perform a number of web site and web page validation tasks at one time. The tool crawls a site to find all of the documents then analyses each document with a number of validation tools.

Version 4.0.1 contains the following updates and additions
 - Add open data checking tool (open_data_check.pl and desktop shortcut)  to check open dataset files (dictionary, data, resources).
 - Do case insensitive checks on titles to find matching HTML and PDF versions of a document.
 - Allow for binary data in CSV files (e.g. new-line in the cell content).
 - Report Interoperability failure for web feeds that do not parse properly - SWI_B.
 - Check for table headers that reference undefined headers or headers outside the current table - WCAG_2.0-H43.
 - Check for all language markers to determine if a page is archived or not (handles the case where wrong language message is used).
 - Encode text that is written to results tabs, this eliminates garbled French characters.
 - Report unknown mime-type documents as non-HTML primary format.
 - Accept enter key in URL list tab to move to the next input line.
 - Check for very long (> 500 characters) title and heading text - WCAG_2.0-H42, WCAG_2.0-H25
 - Don't report zoom failure for fix size fonts as current browsers can handle this - WCAG_2.0-G142
 - Decode HTML entities before checking the length of titles and headings to eliminate the length of the HTML code from the actual text length.


Reminder: The WPSS Tool DOES NOT validate HTML5 markup.
