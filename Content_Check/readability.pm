# The Fog index, developed by Robert Gunning, is a well known

#    14 difficult

# Flesch-Kincaid grade score
#
# This score rates text on U.S. grade school level. So a score
# of 8.0 means that the document can be understood by an eighth
# grader. A score of 7.0 to 8.0 is considered to be optimal.
